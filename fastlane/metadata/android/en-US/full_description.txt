UNOFFICIAL Nextcloud Maps client at its earliest stages of developement. Shows your Nextcloud Maps geobookmarks list.
Geobookmarks can be opened in all apps supporting geo links (i.e. Google Maps, Organic Maps etc...).
A new geobookmark can be created on current location.

Requires Maps app to be installed on the Nextcloud instance.
As per Nextcloud's guidelines, the login is implemented using Nextcloud's Single Sign On module and thus requires Nextcloud Files app installed.
